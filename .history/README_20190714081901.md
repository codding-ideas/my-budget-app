#### project link
https://budget-app-v1.herokuapp.com/

## Technology to be used
a. React-Redux - Frontend

b. Node-js,  Express js, mongoDb - Backend

## How to run this app
1. Clone the app
2. run npm install
3. npm run dev

## Runing both Client and Server
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "server": "nodemon index.js",
    "client": "npm run start --prefix client",
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\" "
  },



## PROXY

1) In the client/ directory install this package:

npm install http-proxy-middleware --save



2) Create setupProxy.js file in client/src/ directory. There is no need to import this file anywhere, CRA looks for a file by this name and loads it.



3) Then add your proxies to the setupProxy.js file:

There are a few different ways to add proxies:

Method 1:

(Thanks to Torleif B. for finding this cleaner more efficient method)

const proxy = require('http-proxy-middleware')
 
module.exports = function(app) {
    app.use(proxy(['/api', '/auth/google'], { target: 'http://localhost:5000' }));
}


Method 2:

const proxy = require('http-proxy-middleware');
 
module.exports = function(app) {
    app.use(proxy('/auth/google', { target: 'http://localhost:5000' }));
    app.use(proxy('/api/**', { target: 'http://localhost:5000' }));
};


5) Restart start your servers with npm run dev and the proxies should now work as expected. Note - Anytime you make a change to the proxy or the Google Project's URI or Origins settings you should restart the server.


## POINTS
Always set your header to content-type application/json

# express validator
we pass it as a second middleware to a route


## Creating express validator

```javascript

usersRouter.post('/', [check('name', 'Name is require').not().isEmpty(),
check('email', 'Email is required').isEmail(),
check('password', 'Password is required with minimum length of 4').isLength({min: 4})
], (req, res) => {
   console.log(req.body)
})
```
